2026-02-11: Added trump suit selector, trick-winner calculation considering trump and lead suit, per-team trick (hand) counts, and team 10-count display in CardTracker.html. Also added current trick leader text ("is this trick winning?") based on partial tricks.
2026-02-11: Fixed 10s scoring: 10s are now counted as "captured" by the trick-winning team (not the team/player who played the 10). Added a separate Scoreboard UI under Tricks showing per-team Tricks and 10s (captured). Team headers no longer show tricks/10s.
2026-02-11: Made UI more mobile-friendly. Added responsive media queries to shrink fonts/padding on small screens, change deck grid to 7 columns (tablets) and 4 columns (phones), stack top control buttons full-width on phones, force teams into a single column on narrow screens, and make the player-selection modal/buttons full-width and easier to tap on mobile.
2026-02-11: Improved responsive behavior. Changed deck grid to use auto-fit with minmax so the number of columns is dynamic and always fits the screen. Prevented horizontal overflow on body. Updated small-screen button rules so buttons size to their text (no forced 100% width) while still wrapping nicely.
2026-02-11: On desktop (>=1024px) the deck grid now forces 13 columns so each suit forms a clear row (since cards are already generated suit-by-suit). On smaller screens it still uses auto-fit for dynamic columns.
2026-02-11: When "Show Remaining Only" is enabled, used cards are replaced with invisible placeholder cells so that on desktop the 13-column suit rows stay aligned even for remaining-only view. On mobile/tablet these placeholders are not rendered, keeping the layout compact.
2026-02-11: Added start screen overlay where selecting a trump suit is mandatory before play; also allows entering initial player names. Added ability to rename players by clicking their names. Enforced "one card per player per trick" by blocking assigning a card to a player who has already played in the current (incomplete) trick; they can play again only after the next trick starts. Reset now returns to the start screen.
2026-02-11: Added "Dehla Pakad Rules" button that opens a scrollable modal showing the contents of dehlaPakadRules.txt so players can read the full rules in-app.***
2026-02-11: Improved Scoreboard UI to a cleaner table-style layout. Replaced inline scoreboard table styles with dedicated classes in script.js, moved scoreboard wrapper styling from inline HTML into styles.css, and added polished table visuals (header row, borders, striping, spacing, and mobile-friendly sizing).
2026-02-11: Improved player selection popup UX: players who have already played in the current trick now appear greyed out and disabled in the modal, instead of only being blocked after click.
